	Waliullah Matoo, born in the village of Ohangam Beerwah Budgam around 1795 C.E, He was from Akhoon Peerzadah family. He has three brothers also Gafoor Shah, Khaleel Shah and Jameel Shah. Only Gafoor's children are residing in this village. Matoo had no son. Waliullah used to teach  in his own village. Matoo was a devoted listener of Mirwaiz Kashmir. One day in a sermon gathering he heard a Naat Shareef from Mirwaiz;<br>
<p style="text-align:center;">کے بود یا رب کہ رو در یثرب و بطحا کُنم<br>
گہ بمَکہ منزل و گہ در مدینہ جا کُنم۔<b><br>
His heart was so moved that he stood warmly in the gathering and addressed Mirwaiz and said loudly, "What is your "Buwadd" saying? I am leaving now. In the midst of this confusion and anxiety, he reached the village of  Chewdara, where Pir Ali Shah was preparing for Hajj. Waliullah  left with him. After completing rights in Makkah they both left  towards Madinah Munawarrah, Waliullah fell into a state of ecstasy on the way and began to recite naats. After that, they reached Madinah and Waliullah died in Madinah in the year of 1858, then Pir Ali Shah buried him there and came back to his village.
He was a contemporary with Mahmud Gami, so the meeting with Mahmud Gami is mentioned in his Masnavi "Hee Maal". Which has been recorded in Mahmud Gami's Tazkirah.
