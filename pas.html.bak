		Pir Ali Shah was a resident of Chewdara Beerwah Budgam, grandson of an admired saint Hazrat Syed Mir Muhammad Simnani, who was a Sufi poet, writer and one of the Successor of Syed Ali Allauddin Razvi Al-Bukhari (disciple of Naseeb Ud Din Ghazi). Ali Shah remained with the circle of the disciples of Baba Naseeb Ud Din Ghazi.
When he went to the pilgrimage (Makkah) with the another famous poet Waliullah Matoo (died in Madinah), in 1858. He returned alone and after a soon he left this world.
Pir Ali Shah wrote a lot, but today some of his work has been preserved thankfully.<br>
Here is the list;<br>
• Jang-i-Deenur (history)<br>
• Wafat Namah (mathnavi)<br>
• Jang-i-Zytoon (history)<br>
• Qissah Tameem Ansari (literature)<br>
• Umm-ul-Moumineen (bio.)<br>
Mostly he is the author of one of the most popular Mathnavi which is khadijah namah in kashmiri. It is attributed to Khadijah bint Khuwaylid the first Wife of Prophet Muhammad. The Pir's primary intention in the mathnavi is to portray a woman who is a paragon of all virtues and noble disposition and for this primary motive, he chose a language which is mellifluous, made more appealing by the devotional songs in the style of marriage lays, interspersed in the text. The Holy Prophet's love as an affectionate husband and Khadijah's response guided by virtue and piety, all is admirably captured by the poet/
